# About me

I'm a third year undergraduate at [HKUST(GZ)](https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/), majoring in AI Thrust. I'm interested in quantum information, quantum computing, quantum AI and so on. I'm now participating in [QuAIR](https://www.quair.group/) and expecting the first paper about quantum purification.
